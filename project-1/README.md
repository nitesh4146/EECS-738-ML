## Gussian Mixture Model
This project implements Gussian Mixture Model and it's expectaition maximization algorithm. We further dive deeper into three different dataset from [UCI ML dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), namely,  
[1] Iris
[2] Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast CancerÂ¶
[3] Wine Quality

### Correlation Matrix (Wine Quality Dataset)  
Strong correlation implies higher effect on output feature. Selecting the best correlation features gives more accurate and generalized clustering output.
